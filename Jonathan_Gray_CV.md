    deployment edge cases and lack of testing that had caused service
    and in-turn customer impact. Wrote unit tests, sanity tests and made
    pipeline changes to prevent future reoccurrence.

-   Delivered projects related to security findings rolled out the
    changes across multiple regions and availability zones

-   Authored and re-vamped operational runbooks and documentation to
    improve on-call response and reduce time to resolution

-   Built and maintained tooling in Python, Bash, and Ruby to support
    deployment automation, validation, and CI/CD workflows.

-   Service code changes in Java to address bugs and to enable
    compatibility for database migration and for region builds.
